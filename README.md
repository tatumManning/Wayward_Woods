# Wayward Woods
This is a mobile game built for iOS. It gives the users options as they traverse through a forest after getting lost. The user is given prompts and they must click the path they wish to follow. The game ends when the user either finds their way back or gets taken by creatures that dwell in the magical forest.
## How it's Made:
**Tech Used:**
Swift, Xcode

This application was my first solo project, therefore it is quite straightforward. I used only a View layer. I included text boxes and buttons for moving through the game. I added images to serve as the background and edited the text and buttons to fit the theme. All constraints for the View were done manually.
